### Hi, im Ola 👋

<!--
**olaamb/olaamb** is a ✨ _special_ ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile. 

Im currently studying to become a java-developer at IT-högskolan in Gothenburg. My first mission in programming is to try to soak up whatever is ahead of me. Im hoping to be able to use my skills to eventually contribute to something positive for people in this world.
